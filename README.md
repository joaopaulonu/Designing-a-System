<img width="1024" height="370" alt="System Design Diagram" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6098940-e43f-4d35-a7d7-7fb7c373e5a4" />

## 📄 Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive study on the **fundamental principles of system design**, with a focus on adaptability to evolving requirements. System design is a multidisciplinary process that involves analyzing and synthesizing various engineering domains to arrive at robust, efficient, and scalable solutions.

The topics covered here illustrate the intricate relationship between **creativity**, **technical constraints**, and **engineering disciplines**, all of which contribute to shaping a final product or system.

## 🔑 Key Disciplines in System Design

- **Kinematics**  
  Studies the motion of rigid bodies based on geometry and displacement, without considering the forces involved.

- **Dynamics**  
  Ensures that system components perform their intended functions, accounting for inertia, acceleration, and velocity.

- **Strength of Materials**  
  Guarantees structural integrity under stress, heat, and other conditions that may cause deformation or failure.

- **Thermodynamics**  
  Defines dimensions and geometry to prevent components from reaching critical temperatures that compromise strength.

- **Fluid Mechanics**  
  Analyzes fluid-induced loads to optimize component shapes and leverage fluid properties for system performance.

- **Tribology**  
  Focuses on wear and friction between surfaces, emphasizing proper lubrication and material preservation.

- **Materials Science**  
  Selects appropriate materials based on hardness, elasticity, tensile strength, and cost-effectiveness.

- **Manufacturing Technology**  
  Determines suitable production processes aligned with the geometry and specifications defined by prior analyses.

- **Economics**  
  Influences design decisions by aiming to reduce production costs while maintaining performance and quality.
