## üîë Key Disciplines in System Design

- **Kinematics:** Defines the relationship between geometry and physical quantities such as position and displacement of rigid bodies, without considering the forces causing the motion.  

- **Dynamics:** Ensures that the device‚Äôs parts perform their intended functions, taking into account inertia and differential relationships such as acceleration and velocity.  

- **Strength of Materials:** Guarantees that the system‚Äôs geometric form is preserved, even under loads, heat, or other factors that could cause deformation or failure.  

- **Thermodynamics:** Defines dimensions and geometry to ensure components do not reach temperatures that could compromise their mechanical strength.  

- **Fluid Mechanics:** Determines the loads generated by liquids to optimize component geometry and dimensions, allowing the system to benefit from fluid properties.  

- **Tribology:** Similar to strength of materials, but focuses on wear caused by friction, aiming to ensure proper lubrication of contacting parts.  

- **Materials Science:** Studies and defines the most suitable material for components based on parameters such as hardness, elasticity modulus, tensile strength, and cost.  

- **Manufacturing Technology:** Determines the most appropriate manufacturing processes for the components, considering the geometry and characteristics defined by previous studies.  

- **Economics:** Contributes to defining component geometry and design by seeking to minimize production costs.
